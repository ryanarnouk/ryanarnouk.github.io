Hi, I'm Ryan, an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia wrapping up my degree next year.


I like to write computer programs. My main interests lie in software engineering, where I have experience in backend development, cloud infrastructure, and full-stack engineering. Recently, I've been diving deeper into operating systems, compilers, programming languages, and runtimes. On this site, I write about these topics.


Outside of my own software engineering journey, I am interested in pedagogy and teaching.

## Experience
- Software Engineer Intern (incoming return) @ PayPal
- Software Engineer Intern @ PayPal
- Software Developer Co-Op @ Copperleaf
- Software Engineer Intern @ SkyHive

You can learn more about my experience in depth on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanarnouk/). 

In brief, I've worked extensively in Java, C#, and TypeScript throughout my internship experience.


Over at PayPal, I integrated a third-party platform, Sprig, into the PayPal Payouts (Hyperwallet) platform. This included writing scripts for new analytic features in JavaScript integrated into the platform, and extending the applications backend with new functionality to retrieve user information and transfer the information over to the platform. 


At Copperleaf, I worked on a backend API adhering to the SCIM standard (RFC 7644). I also developed a cloud architecture on AWS for an event-driven job scheduler. I worked with a lot of AWS services, including API Gateway, Step Functions, Elastic Container Service, Simple Queue Service, DynamoDB, and IAM to name a few. 


## Projects
A more comprehensive list of my side projects can be found on my GitHub. I've included a link and brief descriptions of my more recent ones completed in the last ~5 years here. 

- [FileScript](https://github.com/ryanarnouk/FileScript) - a DSL implemented in Java for searching for files based on metadata and other properties
- [Runtime VM](https://github.com/ryanarnouk/runtime-vm) - an in-progress virtual machine inspired by the JVM and .NET Runtime, implementing my own programming language
- [Breathe App](https://github.com/ryanarnouk/nwhacks-2024) - an air quality monitor providing insights into a space 
- [Discover Machine Learning](https://github.com/ryanarnouk/Discover-Machine-Learning) - an interactive introduction into the world of basic machine learning concepts
with a visual block editor, targetted towards elementary-aged students
- [This Website](https://github.com/ryanarnouk/site) - my third (or fourth, I forgot the count at this point) rewrite of my personal site. This time, I wrote a custom static site generator in Rust (got tired of keeping NPM dependencies up to date) 
- [AnkiGPT](https://github.com/ryanarnouk/anki-gpt-desktop) - an integration between Anki (the flashcard program) and OpenAI's ChatGPT API. I wrote the first version as a website (using TypeScript and Python) and later rewrote it as a desktop application using Rust, TypeScript, and Tauri.

## UBC
At UBC, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. UBC Presidential Scholar's Award Recipient (BMO Financial Group National Scholarship). An entrance scholarship renewed for four years of study. 


While here, I was an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for CPSC 310 (Introduction to Software Engineering), an upper-year course required for UBC Computer Science undergraduates. I also mentored at NW Hacks 2025, UBC's largest hackathon (and participated in 2024).


Most of the courses I have completed focus around software engineering, programming languages (interpreters and compilers), networking, databases, and distributed systems. A more comprehensive list of my relevant courses can be found [here](/university).
