My own personal website, bundled with a static site generator written in Rust.

## Motivation

I want to develop a robust and solid site without worrying about maintenance and package upgrades for the foreseeable future.

My old personal pages usually rely on too many tools and the pace of development and upgrade cycles outpaces the amount of time I am able to spend maintaining the project. I end up having old projects with terribly old code bases that need upgrading.

At times, it was even easier to settle with remaking my personal page altogether. My hope with offering a greater level of control over the SSG in this version of my site is that this will not need to happen as often.

## SSG

I originally intended to write the static site generator component of the project in OCaml but later settled for Rust.

## Site

Biolerplate markdown parsing tests: 

- one
- two
- three
- four

```rust
function code() {
  console.log("Test code");
}
```
