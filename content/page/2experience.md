You can learn more about my experience in depth on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanarnouk/). 

In brief, I've worked extensively in Java, C#, and TypeScript throughout my internship experience.

Over at PayPal, I integrated a third-party platform, Sprig, into the PayPal Payouts (Hyperwallet) platform. This included writing scripts for new analytic features in JavaScript, and extending the application's backend with new functionality to retrieve user information and transfer the information over to the third-party vendor. 

At Copperleaf, I worked on a backend API adhering to the SCIM standard (RFC 7644). I also developed a cloud architecture on AWS for an event-driven job scheduler. I worked with a lot of AWS services, including API Gateway, Step Functions, Elastic Container Service, Simple Queue Service, DynamoDB, and IAM to name a few. 

Outside of software, I enjoy teaching. I ran my own personal tutoring business for a number of years and more recently was an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for CPSC 310 (Introduction to Software Engineering) at UBC.
