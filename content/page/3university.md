## UBC

At UBC, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. UBC Presidential Scholar's Award Recipient (BMO Financial Group National Scholarship). An entrance scholarship renewed for four years of study. 

I was an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for CPSC 310 (Introduction to Software Engineering), an upper-year course required for UBC Computer Science undergraduates. I also mentored at NW Hacks 2025, UBC's largest hackathon (and participated in 2024).

Most of the courses I have completed focus around software engineering, programming languages (interpreters and compilers), networking, databases, and distributed systems. A more comprehensive list of my relevant courses can be found below. 

## Courses
###  Computer Science
 
**CPSC 411: Introduction to Compiler Construction**

Wrote a compiler in Racket for a language that is a subset of Racket (roughly similar to a C-like abstraction level) targetting x86. 

**CPSC 410: Advanced Software Engineering**

Learned about designing and implementing a domain specific langauge and various types of program analysis. Completed a project on FileScript (a domain specific langauge) and DSA (a tool for visualizing lock dependencies statically to inform programmers about potential deadlocks)

**CPSC 416: Distributed Systems**

Learned and implemented various distributed systems, including the RAFT consensus algorithm.

**CPSC 404: Advanced Relational Databases**

Explored relational database systems (notably IBM Db2 mainly) diving deep into query optimization, concurrency, crash recovery, physical design, and indexing.

**CPSC 311: Definition of Programming Languages**

Programming theory exploring interpreters and the definition of programming languages, including variable binding, data types, etc.

**CPSC 320: Intermediate Algorithm Design and Analysis**
