### CPSC 411: Introduction to Compiler Construction

Wrote a compiler in Racket for a language that is a subset of Racket (roughly similar to a C-like abstraction level) targetting x86. 

### CPSC 410: Advanced Software Engineering

Learned about designing and implementing a domain specific langauge and various types of program analysis. Completed a project on FileScript (a domain specific langauge) and DSA (a tool for visualizing lock dependencies statically to inform programmers about potential deadlocks)

### CPSC 416: Distributed Systems

Learned and implemented various distributed systems, including the RAFT consensus algorithm.

### CPSC 311: Definition of Programming Languages

Programming theory exploring interpreters and the definition of programming languages, including variable binding, data types, etc.

### CPSC 320: Intermediate Algorithm Design and Analysis
